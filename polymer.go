// The polymer library can be used to work with polymer using GopherJS instead of having to write straight up JavaScript.
// Simple examples to get started are available in the examples/ subfolder. It is highly recommend to go through them.
//
// The polymer website itself also has a great deal of information on how to get started, most of the information available there
// also applies to the Go bindings of polymer.
